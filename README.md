#Camber Proof of Concept

I set myself a challenge for this interview.

24 hours. React Native from scratch. Render a map with friends and their randomly generated "recommendations."

The backend runs from www.erikgratz.com, the data is randomly generated.

If you would like to run the project, clone the repo, cd to the directory and run `expo start`. Once the server is started, use the web interface to start your preferred mobile emulator.
